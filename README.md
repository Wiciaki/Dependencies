# Spark's EloBuddy Dependencies
Workaround to EloBuddy's addon installer being restrictive and all the other good, open source stuff!

# SparkTech.Loader
##### PLEASE NOTE THIS IS NOT A CRACK OF ANY SORT
Its job is to launch the official loader while making sure the SDK libraries are in place and that SparkTech marked assemblies can be compiled.
Other features are autoupdates - swift and silent on launch, you won't probably even notice them happening : )

As well as shortcut creation on desktop, this shortcut should be used by you to launch EloBuddy from now on.
If you aren't interested in said shortcut, please create an empty file called "noshortcut" (must have no extension) and put it in the same folder as loaders.

A TODO is desktop notification when EloBuddy gets updated but its far future - I haven't found a lightweight way to develop that yet.
